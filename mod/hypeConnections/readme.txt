hypeConnections is part of the hypeJunction bundle


hypeConnections is a novel, unstereotyped approach to social networking through Elgg. It's designed in a form of a relationship management plugin, but has far more potential. With LinkedIn concepts in mind, it allows you to cross-connect content and users, thus creating an easily navigated space.

With hypeConnections you can define reciprocal and one-way connections. Supported connections are:
user-to-user (e.g. Counsellor-Student or Research Supervisor-Researcher)
user-to-object (e.g. Collaborator (user) to Research Paper (page))
reverse user-to-object (defined automatically when user-to-object is created).
object-to-object (e.g. Company to a Job, or Company to a Product Listing)

This plugin also creates access collections based on user's connections. User can limit visibility of their content to certain connections only.
