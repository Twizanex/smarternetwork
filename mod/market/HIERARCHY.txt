This version of the market plugin includes changes to allow for hierarchical
assets.

The hierarchy is as follows:

marketcategory
family
parent
individual
element

When you create a basic asset, you specify the title, description,
marketcategory, tags, image, and access.

The possible market categories are defined in the market plugin settings.

Depending upon the marketcategory selected and the available form definitions, 
the user can optionally add additional information when adding or editing 
an asset.

In order to define a level in the hierarchy, you need to define an edit form
and a display view. These will then be automatically picked up by the system.

The edit forms should be located in the views/default/forms/market/edit 
directory.

The display views should be located in the views/default/market/display
directory.

There is one included example directory for a "shoes" marketcategory. This
supports two "shoes" family levels: running and dress.

The main shoes form is in:

 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes.php
 
 and the family sublevel forms are defined in
 
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/running.php
 and
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/dress.php
 
 If you wanted to continue the hierarchy to the parent level 
 (say for men and women) these forms would be in, for example
 
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/dress/men.php
 and
 views/default/forms/market/edit/shoes/dress/women.php
 
 and the dress.php form would need to define a "parent" field
 with possible values men or women.
 
 The display views are organised in a similar hierarchical way.
